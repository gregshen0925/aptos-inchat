# Aptos InChat
Chatting Dapp using Aptos Token Design

## Vision
As proof of concept, InChat app showcases how the combination of "Aptos token design" and "InJoy profile module" can optimize exclusive communitiesâ€™ user experience.

## Universal Profile Module on Aptos

## InChat Module
 - repo: https://github.com/JustaLiang/aptos-inchat-module
 - Wrapped Aptos token and toke_tansfers module
 
## Aptos InChat App
 - repo: https://github.com/gregshen0925/aptos-inchat
 - Frontend and backend of the app

## How InChat was built
1. InChat_V1 module (Move Language)
2. Metadata storage (IPFS + Aptos Token Module)
3. Nextjs13 for optimizing user experience
4. Frontend design (Tailwind CSS + SASS)
5. Data subscription and optimizing (Pusher)
6. Aptos Wallet Integration (Hippospace)
7. Typescript Aptos SDK

## Target Users
Exclusive communities, DAOs, chat groups can be token-gated through an Aptos NFT.

## What's next for Aptos InChat?
In the next few months we will work on an universal identity layer that uses the same token design as a decentralized identity token for people.
